# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Maxwell. I like to code. I live in Australia and have two pet budgies and am hoping to get chickens as soon as the lockdown ends.

I like coding because it helps me pass the time. I post my code on Github because I can easily share it with friends.

## Projects

My main project is TheKlukr, a bot for Discord servers. It has a personality like a chicken and is very funny at times.

I am currently planning other projects as well. Follow me to see my projects! ðŸ˜€
